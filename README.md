# Blackbird Interviews

I created this project to demonstrate my ability to drive technology for an interview at Blackbird on 5/25/21. 

## Project Purpose 
This project serves as a POC for customizing a homepage to include local favorites. Local favorites are dispensaries nearby a latitude and longtitude coordinate. For the purposes of this POC the longititude and latitude is hardcoded to one near Reno, NV. The data is retrieved using the google places api and sorted by prominence. In the future, the longititude and latitude coordinates can be converted from user inputted address or zipcode using the geocoder provided by the google maps API. 

## Tech Stack 
Frontend: React, Javascript 
Backend: Google Maps Platform 

## Limitations 
If this were to be inplemented the backend would need to connect to the Blackbird backend. An example for how I would design such a backend can be found here.
